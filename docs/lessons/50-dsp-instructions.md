# New DSP Instructions in the Pico 2

!!! prompt
    What are the new DSP assembly language functions in the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 RP2350 instruction set ARMv8-M + Thumb-2. How can they be used to speed up a FFT algorithm

!!! note
    As of March 22nd, 2025 when this was written, OpenAI's ChatGPT o1 knowledge cutoff date is June 2024. The Pico 2 was introduced on Aug 8, 2024.  So OpenAi is not aware of the Pico 2 announcement and its features.  This is why I used Perplexity since it is able to search the current internet as sources for its results.

## Perplexity Response

The new Raspberry Pi Pico 2’s RP2350 microcontroller introduces enhanced DSP capabilities through its ARMv8-M architecture and Thumb-2 instruction set, enabling significant performance improvements for FFT algorithms. Here’s how these features are leveraged.

### Key DSP Assembly Language Functions

#### 1. **Floating-Point Unit (FPU) Integration** 

The RP2350 includes a dedicated FPU, allowing hardware-accelerated floating-point operations critical for FFTs. This replaces slower software-based emulation used in the earlier RP2040, reducing computation time for operations like complex multiplications and additions[^2][^3].

#### 2. **Thumb-2 Instruction Set**

Thumb-2 combines 16- and 32-bit instructions, improving code density and execution efficiency. For example:

```armasm
; Example: Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation using FPU
VMLA.F32 S0, S1, S2  ; S0 = S0 + (S1 * S2)
```

This single-cycle MAC instruction accelerates FFT’s butterfly operations[^1][^4].

#### 3. **DSP Extensions**

ARMv8-M adds DSP-oriented instructions like SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) for parallel processing. For instance:

```armasm
; SIMD example for parallel data processing
VADD.F32 Q0, Q1, Q2  ; Add four 32-bit floats in Q1 and Q2, store in Q0
```
This reduces loop overhead in FFT stages by processing multiple data points simultaneously[^2][^4].



### Optimizing FFT with RP2350 Assembly

#### 1. **Hardware-Accelerated Arithmetic** 

- Replace software-based floating-point operations with FPU instructions.  
- Use `VFP` registers (S0-S31) for intermediate FFT results to avoid memory bottlenecks[^3][^5].

#### 2. **Loop Unrolling and Register Management**  
Unroll FFT butterfly loops in assembly to minimize branch penalties. Prioritize registers R0-R7 (Thumb-2’s low registers) for frequent operations[^1][^6].  
   Example:

```armasm
; Unrolled loop for FFT stage
.thumb_func
fft_stage:
    VLD1.F32 {S0-S3}, [R0]!  ; Load 4 floats
    VADD.F32 S4, S0, S1      ; Compute real part
    VSUB.F32 S5, S0, S1      ; Compute imaginary part
    VST1.F32 {S4-S5}, [R1]!  ; Store results
```

#### 3. **Memory Optimization**  

Use DMA channels to asynchronously transfer audio data from I2S peripherals (e.g., microphones) to RAM, freeing the CPU for FFT computations[^3][^5].

### Performance Impact

A 256-point FFT on the RP2350 completes in **17 ms** using optimized ARM assembly, compared to ~50 ms on the RP2040[^3]. Key metrics:

- **FPU Utilization**: Reduces floating-point operation latency by 4–10×lessons.  
- **SIMD Parallelism**: Processes 2–4 data points per instruction, cutting FFT stage time by up to 50%[^5].  

For real-time audio applications (e.g., spectrum analyzers), this allows:

- 8 kHz sampling with 256-point FFTs at **13.1 FPS**[^3].  
- Lower latency for effects like reverb or noise suppression[^5].

### Implementation Steps

1. **Toolchain Setup**

Use the `pico-sdk` with `.thumb_func` directives to ensure Thumb-2 compatibility[^1].

2. **Leverage Existing Libraries** 

Adapt ARM-optimized FFT libraries (e.g., Peter Hinch’s FFT library) to exploit RP2350-specific instructions[^3][^5].

3. **Profiling**

Use cycle-counting tools to identify bottlenecks in FFT stages and replace them with inline assembly[^6].

By integrating these techniques, developers can achieve real-time FFT performance on the Pico 2 for audio processing, spectral analysis, and IoT applications.
