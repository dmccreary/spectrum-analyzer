# Glossary of Terms

#### ARMv8-M

A special version of the ARM version 8 instruction set customized for Microcontrollers that need to have signal processing capabilities.

Note that the "-M" suffix denotes the "Microcontroller" version.

####  Butterfly Operation

#### Fast Fourier Transform

### Fourier Transform

#### INMP441 Microphone

#### ISO Definition

A term definition is considered to be consistent with ISO metadata registry guideline 11179 if it meets the following criteria:

1. Precise
2. Concise
3. Distinct
4. Non-circular
5. Unencumbered with business rules

#### Single Instruction Multiple Data

A single assembler instruction that works on multiple data elements.

**Example:** ARMv8-M adds DSP-oriented instructions like SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) for parallel processing. For instance, the ARM VADD.F32 operator does vector addtions on multiple data elements.  This reduces loop overhead in FFT stages by processing multiple data points simultaneously.

* Also known as: SIMD
